<h3>DEVOLUTION</h3>

<p>This app is very much under construction.</p>

<h3>You can view a <a href="https://glensimister.github.io/devolution/">DEMO</a> here although it may not render that well on older browsers.</h3>
<p>
There's also a youtube video...

<p>Any money that goes into Devolution is redistributed in the form of Social Credits. You can use these credits to finance various activities on the platform. </p>

<p>The app (screenshot below) has sections for voting, financing public services, collectively buying and renting out land. It has an affordable housing section, an education section, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>The prototype (as presented in the video) was built using the Safenetwork browser/api. However, for now at least, I have decided to switch to a more a centralized approach to make it easier to develop.</p>
