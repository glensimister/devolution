<p>Any money that goes into Devolution is redistributed in the form of Social Credits. You can use these credits to finance various activities on the platform. </p>

<p>The app (screenshot below) has sections for voting, financing public services, collectively buying and renting out land. It has an affordable housing section, an education section, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>The app is very much under construction and I would greatly appreciate some support. The prototype (as presented in the video) was built using the Safenetwork browser/api. However, I have decided to switch to a more a centralized approach for now to make it easier to develop. As it stands, i'm using Solid and GunDB, which may be subject to change.</p>
