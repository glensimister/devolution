        <p>This is not a constitution in the traditional sense of the word as most of the rules are defined by the application itself and the application will naturally evolve over time. Instead, the purpose of this constitution is to define a basic set of rights which apply to all citizens.</p>
        <h4>Property Rights</h4>
        <p>There are two main types of property: Private and Public.</p>
        <p><b>Private property</b> includes anything which is either directly or indirectly the product of one's labour.</p>
        <p><b>Public property</b> includes anything which is neither directly or indirectly the product of one's labour. This includes finite natural resources such as undeveloped land, unrefined oil, and so on.</p>
        <!--<p><b>Intellectual property</b> is a mix between public property and private property since our ideas derive from other peoples ideas, yet we expend energy into developing these ideas. As such, we need a system which enables us to accurately quantify the value of a persons input, and credit them accordingly.</p>-->

        <p>Neither the Government nor the citizens are permitted to violate someone's property rights, unless the violation of property rights has been chosen as a suitable punishment for a particular crime.</p>
        <p>Neither the Government nor the citizens are permitted to initiate the use of force.</p>
